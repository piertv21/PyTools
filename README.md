# PyTools
List of Python scripts that I use sometimes.

**SCRIPT LIST:**
- **PDFPageCounter:** count the number of pages in all PDFs in a folder and all its subfolders, convenient to get an idea of how many pages to study per day.
- **SubitoJSONScraper:** saves all data about a profile sales ads in JSON format.
